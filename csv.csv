OST was fitting,Steins;Gate 0,"After clearing up the plot holes, this show has become my favorite of all time. It makes me feel things that other shows fail to do. It puts Re: Zero to shame with its nuanced char work, intricate story, and perfect intermingling of the two. It truly is a show of the ages, and it deserves the respect of all. It doesn't hold your hand, but it's not overly complex. It's a show that hits on drama, comedy, tension, and everything. I don't see a flaw. There's nothing not to like. It truly is the perfect show",,,

Not a bad song,,"I wanted a good movie, and I got a great one. The chars are endearing. The story is sweet and connectible no matter who you are. The themes are impactful and fleshed out. The animation, setting, and music blend together perfectly to make one of the most touching stories I've seen in a long time.

It does everything it wants to while also reminding me just how much it means to express yourself to others in every way possible",,,

OST is aight,,"Even when I think the characters are repeating themselves or have suddenly gotten over their issues, they act more human and either double down on their fears, a relapse of sorts, or another human truth is revealed. The show knows what chars are doing what at every time, taking note of every char as they weave in and out of the narrative. It makes for a satisfying drama even if it might, at first, seem extremely melow-dramatic. Overall, a beauitful and realistic commentary on social life with a supernatural twist",,,

It was fluid and lively. Expressions hit diff,Nothing great,,"This truly is the best comedy I've seen. Combined with wholesome moments and lowkey char development, the show delivers on making me burst out laughing with its ridiculous plot lines and twists. It answers every question I might have over time, allowing for fluid continuity. It tells a unique story that doesn't get too mushy-gushy as it stays true to its chars and ends up being a product that I could rewatch at any time.

They were their own unique individuals that never seemed to stop moving as the plot formed from the interactions of tens of chars. It made for a story that had a beautiful theme about storytelling and human interaction. I've never seen a show that mixed complicated chars and plot while still being relatively easy to follow",,,

It helps when the most complex part makes sense,Lowkey some of the best shit I've ever seen. Movie quality for 13 eps,"Op was sweet and OST had some funk to it, albeit used poorly",,"This show didn't disappoint. It's a thematic slam dunk in every possible way. Through an entertaining story of toil and independent decision-making that truly highlights the fragility of humans and the sheer difficulty of standing up for someone else, especially when you have your own problems. With an incomplete story and pacing that's a bit quick in areas, this show did its heavy lifting in the char department. The ending is still good bc of how the show has got us to appreciate the individuality of each char",,,

I only wish that Kiba had some more development before he became our definitive MC bc he felt a little one-note. With so much going on in the plot, it did a nice job of guiding us through the plot, giving us hints as we went along; however, by the end, we did need a bit more info to make sense of some moments. That being said, it got emotional in the end and was satisfying in its conclusion",,,

What do you expect?,Definitely helped with setting the moods,,"If it weren't for some bum, minor chars and story details that seemed contrived (like the fights at the end of the original show), then this show would have been a 10/10. It is such a heartwarming, intricate story that succeeds in every way. The compilation of theme, story, char, and world into this story, tying everyone together and fitting them along the main storyline for fulfilling and moving pay-offs is SO FREAKING GOOD.

There's highs and lows, and it felt like something I had experienced. It was grounded and knew what it needed to do ","Stunningly beautiful, but not complex enough to be memorable","The CGI and some movement sucked. Otherwise, really good",Op was fitting,,"This show painted a realistic portrait of young love. Every moment was relatable to some degree, and while the constant reminders of my own reality kept me from really diving into the emotion, the whimsical beauty of their struggles shown through in the end. The shorts were also great additions. Chars acted like normal people and the story never strayed into cliche territory. Never treated the audience like children with overexplanations either. Mature in its tone. Overall, a lovely reflection on youthful love.",,,

It felt alive and fluid,Op and ED were tight,,"Although it'll always be compared to K-ON, I think Tamako stands out as its own piece of art. It's themes are much deeper than K-ONs while still fostering the same sense of childishness and fun that K-ON did. Other than some pacing issues in early episodes where events went by way too quickly. this show did everything it tried to do, delivering heart warming stories about a community that has grown up together.

Nevertheless, it never seemed to go too slowly during s1 & s2",There isn't a whole lot in terms of char being instilled in the setting,It's Kyoto. What do you expect? 2.0,"Surprisingly, not that great outside of the performances",season 3 - ???,"Outside of the movie's rushedness, which is excusable given the appropriate end result, my only complaint comes from Asuka, who becomes a pivotal influence on Kumiko. Their relationship isn't developed enough like a lot of the others. It makes for a very weak ending to s2, especially given that the last ep is about their relationship. Despite this, everything is so tightly written and expertly given the appropriate amount of attention that there's nothing else to complain about. Truly is a band geek's dream anime",,,

Otherwise, it's god tier","Haven't seen everything, and the magic system isn't too great. But, it hasn't been presented in full yet",Godly work here. It doesn't get much better than this show here. Tight af,A lot of good Ops,,"The pervertedness went a little overboard on this one, and the char and story's sense of progression was really stalled by the massive leaps in time. However, other than that the story rocks. Every complaint I may have had was addressed, namely the lack of tension, which was solved by the overarching goals now assigned to Rudy. You truly get a sense that every char is well-rounded and has a clear arc going on. This makes the constant mistakes and grayness of every decision even better. I WANT S2",,,

Char designs were great and fit",Beautifully calming. Ops are great,movie,"Episodic shows that relax me will never reach the thought-provoking calming beauty that is Mushi-Shi. It's in-depth, yet shallow, and there wasn't anything to dislike. Although some of the stories failed to be memorable and reached the point of becoming boring, the show's asthetic never wavered. They preached intricate tails and moving themes that are timeless. It truly is a thought-provoking masterpiece with it's nuanced comparisons to real life problems and relationship issues.

It handles heavy moments well and sprinkles in lightheartedness appropriately",Integrated into emotional moments well. Loved the river vibe. Wish I got more of the neighborhood vibe tho,Singlehandedly made the last-minute backstories emotionally impactful,Some Ops and eds are good. And the OST,,"I once thought Nikaidou was annoying, but his arc ended with me enjoying him. My only gripe with this show is that the relationship between Rei and his adopted sister was incomplete. She didn't even come back in s2, which made it all the more disappointing. She just kinda vanished. Everything else was masterful in its emotional and thematic complexity. It's a slice of life that touches every aspect of life from family to careers to dreams to fulfillment to being a friend. All encompassing (& realistic) greatness",,,

It's delivery of a theme about what it means for two people to impact each others' dreams was perfectly on display as the two changed each others' lives by simply understanding what the other wants from life.
